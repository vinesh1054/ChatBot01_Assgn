---

## ** Project Overview**  

This project demonstrates the deployment of the **LLaMA 3.1-8B** model on a local machine without API integration. The chatbot is designed to engage in real-time conversations, retain context, and provide customized responses based on predefined behaviors.  

---

## ** Task Objectives**  

The key objectives of this assignment are:  

 **Model Deployment:**  
- Successfully set up and run **LLaMA 3.1-8B** on a local machine.  
- Ensure the model is capable of processing user inputs and generating responses.  

 **Chat Interaction:**  
- Demonstrate interactive conversation capabilities.  
- Ensure smooth and coherent user interactions.  

 **Context Memory:**  
- Implement memory to retain and recall previous chat exchanges.  
- Validate the chatbot’s ability to remember user-provided details (e.g., names, previous topics).  

 **Identity Response:**  
- Ensure that when asked *"Who are you?"* or *"Who you are?"*, the chatbot **always** responds:  
  - **"I am Vinesh."**

## ** Features Implemented**  

🔹 **Local Model Deployment:** Runs completely on a local machine, without API dependencies.  
🔹 **Conversation Context Retention:** Uses `ConversationBufferMemory` from LangChain to store and recall chat history.  
🔹 **Customizable Responses:**  
   - Greets users appropriately.  
   - Remembers user-provided details during a session.  
   - Always introduces itself as *Vinesh* when prompted.  
🔹 **Web-Based Interface:** Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive chatbot experience.  
🔹 **Persistent Chat History:** Stores previous conversations in a JSON file for continuity.

## ** Demonstration & Testing**  

### **1️ Running the Chatbot (CLI Mode)**  
```sh
python chatbot.py
```

### **2 Running the Chatbot (Web Interface - Streamlit)**  
```sh
streamlit run frontend.py
```

### **3️ Expected Chatbot Behavior**  

**Greeting Users**  
```
User: Hi  
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
```

**Remembering Context**  
```
User: My name is Alex  
Bot: Nice to meet you, Alex!  
User: What’s my name?  
Bot: Your name is Alex.  
```

**Identifying Itself as *Vinesh***  
```
User: Who are you?  
Bot: I am Vinesh.  
```

## **Key Learnings & Insights**  

- Successfully deployed **LLaMA 3.1-8B** in a local environment without requiring API access.  
- Implemented **conversation memory** to enhance contextual understanding.  
- Ensured consistent chatbot identity response as per assignment requirements.  
- Built an interactive UI using **Streamlit** for an improved user experience.

## **Future Scope & Improvements**  

🔹 Optimize memory handling for longer conversation retention.  
🔹 Improve the chatbot’s ability to recall past sessions beyond current runtime.  
🔹 Enhance response generation for more natural and engaging interactions.  
🔹 Expand functionalities by integrating **additional prompt tuning techniques**.
